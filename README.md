# MDP Robot Simulator
This is a project that uses the AIToolbox framework (https://github.com/KevinCoble/AIToolbox.git) to do a continuous state MDP

It shows the concepts well enough, but doesn't always calculate a good policy.  If time permits I will investigate this deeper, but I wanted to get an example of the use of the fittedValueIteration module in AIToolbox
